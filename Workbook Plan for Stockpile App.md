This app will be used by a surveying company that is contracted by a mining company to survey and record stockpile data during opencast mining operations.
The objectives of the app are:

1. Objectives

    Enable seamless recording of stockpile data generated during opencast mining operations.
    find an easy method of identifying stockpiles by material,grade and quantity/volume.
    Provide tools for managing, visualizing, and analyzing stockpile data.
    Ensure accessibility across various devices (mobile and desktop).

2. Key Features

    Data Capture
        Input for stockpile dimensions (length, width, height, etc.).
        Material type and grade classification.
        GPS location tagging of stockpiles.
        Date and time of stockpile creation.

    Inventory Management
        Track stockpile quantity (e.g., tonnage or cubic meters).
        Current status (active, processed, reclaimed).
        Assign responsible teams or personnel.

    Analytics and Reporting
        Generate reports on stockpile status, movement, and trends.
        Visualization tools (charts, 3D models).
        Export data to CSV, Excel, or PDF.

    Integration
        Integration with existing mining systems (ERP, GIS tools, etc.).
        API support for external tools.

    User Management
        Role-based access (e.g., Admin, Supervisor, Worker).
        User activity tracking and logging.

    Offline Functionality
        Allow data entry without an internet connection, with syncing once reconnected.

    Notifications
        Alerts for stockpile age or threshold breaches (e.g., nearing capacity).

3. Technical Components

    Frontend (User Interface)
        Mobile App (React Native or Flutter).
        Web App (React.js or Angular).
        UI/UX design tailored for rugged environments (large buttons, easy navigation).

    Backend
        Node.js, Django, or Spring Boot for API management.
        Database management (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB).

    Database
        Structured database schema for:
            Stockpile information.
            User accounts.
            Historical records.

    Cloud/Storage
        Cloud hosting (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud).
        Secure data backups.

    GIS Integration
        Incorporate mapping tools (e.g., Mapbox, Google Maps API) for GPS tracking.

    Analytics & Reporting
        Use libraries like D3.js or Chart.js for visualizations.
        Integration with business intelligence tools if needed.

    Testing
        Automated testing tools (Selenium, Jest).
        On-site usability testing.

There should be a login screen with auditing control build in , with an access page to add users and manage which permisions they have on the app.
